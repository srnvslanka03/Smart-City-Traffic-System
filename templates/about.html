    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The Smart City Traffic System leverages computer vision algorithms to detect vehicles at intersections in real-time. Using cameras and image processing, it identifies vehicle types and counts, feeding this data into adaptive algorithms that adjust traffic light timings dynamically. This ensures optimal flow by prioritizing busy lanes and reducing unnecessary waiting times.
